# Crop production Analysis in Indian States 
This project leverages a machine learning model to predict crop production based on key agricultural factors. By analyzing features such as crop type, crop year, annual rainfall, area under cultivation, and yield, the model aims to forecast the expected production output. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how machine learning can be applied within the agriculture domain to optimize crop management and decision-making.
